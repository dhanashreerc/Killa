            Rajgad (literal meaning Ruling Fort) is a hill fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. 
            The Rajgad Fort is located around 60 km (37 mi) to the south-west of Pune and about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Nasrapur in the Sahyadris range. 
        <br>The fort lies 1,376 m (4,514 ft) above the sea level. The diameter of the base of the fort was about 40 km (25 mi) which made it difficult to lay siege on it, which added to its strategic value. The fort's ruins consist of palaces, water cisterns, and caves. This fort was built on a hill called Murumbadevi Dongar (Mountain of the Goddess Murumba). Rajgad boasts of the highest number of days stayed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on any fort.

    <p><b>
        History Of Rajgad:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
        Formerly known as Murumdev, the fort was the first capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort. Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort. 
<br><br>
The fort has stood witness to many significant historic events including the birth of Shivaji's son Rajaram I, the death of Shivaji Maharaj’s Queen Saibai, the return of Shivaji Maharaj from Agra, the burial of Afzal Khan's head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Balle Killa, the strict words of Sonopant Dabir to Shivaji Maharaj and many more.
The Rajgad Fort was also one of the 17 forts that Shivaji kept when he signed the Treaty of Purandar in 1665, with the Mughal general Jai Singh I, leader of the Mughal forces. Under this treaty, 23 forts were handed over to the Mughals.
<br><br>
First the fort was under the hands of Ahmed Bahiri Nizamshah in 1490, later in 1626 During the Nizam's last struggle, Adilshah captured the fort. In 1630 The fort was recaptured by Nizamshah with the help of Shahaji Maharaj, and until 1642 the fort was in the jagir of Shahaji Maharaj. 
<br><br>
Later in 1647, Under the age of 16, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured fort Torna (later renamed as Prachandagad ) and adjacent Murumdev (later renamed as Rajgad)  In 1649 Repairs on the fort began and Shamrao Neelkanth Ranzekar was appointed as the Peshwa. In 1654 The fort was renamed as "Rajgad". Construction on new fortifications and buildings commenced.
On 14 January 1658 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj returned to Rajgad after conquering North Konkan and on 11 July 1659 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj went to Pratapgad in order to battle with Afzal Khan. On 5 September 1659 Maharani Saibai (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's wife) died in the Rajgad Fort.
<br><br>
In July 1660 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj escaped from Siddi Jouhar's siege of Panhala and came to Rajgad. Later in July 1661 The idol of Bhavanimata, which was to be established in Pratapgad, was first brought to Rajgad to be inspected by Rajmata Jijabai.  In January 1662 the construction of the Rajgad fort was completed and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj returned to the fort after capturing Pen and Kalyan.
<br><br>
In February 1664 The booty of Surat was brought to Rajgad and On 30th April 1665 the Mughals attacked Rajgad fort but were unsuccessful. In June 1665 during the battle of Purandar, Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj sent a letter of accepting defeat against Mirja Raje Jaisingh. After 5 years on 24th February 1670 Chhatrapati Rajaram was born on the fort, and in 1671 the repairing of the fort began at an expected cost of 10,000 hons. 
<br><br>
After that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Moved his capital to Raigad Fort. 
Later in June1689 The fort was captured by the Mughals after Chhatrapati  Sambhaji Maharaj was executed. And after 1692 Shankarji Narayan captured the fort from the Mughals, and later in 1697 Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj returned to Maharashtra and made Rajgad his new capital. 
<br><br>
On 4th August 1701 Shahaji Mohite was made the havaldar of Padmavati Machi. And on 18th February 1704 The fort was handed over to Aurangzeb as part of a treaty. The fort was renamed to Nabishahagad.
SarSenapti Sidojirao Thopte and Santaji Shilimkar were killed here by Aurangzeb. But later on 29th may 1707 Gunaji Sawant captured the fort and The Maratha War of Independence ended. In 1709 Chhattrapati Shahu Maharaj made provisions for the repairs of the fort. 
<br><br>Later in 1818 The Rajgad fort was passed into the hands of the british.

        Torna Fort, also known as Prachandagad, is a large fort located in Pune district, in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

The hill has an elevation of 1,403 metres (4,603 ft) above sea level, making it the highest hill-fort in the district. The name derives from Prachanda (Marathi for huge or massive) and gad (Marathi for fort).

Previously known as Kondhana, the fort had been the site of many battles, most notably the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. Perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range in the Sahyadri Mountains, the fort is situated on a hill about 760 metres above ground and 1,312 metres above mean sea level.
