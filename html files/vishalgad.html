                    Vishalgad fort, is also called ‘Khelna’ or ‘Khilna’ by locals, and was one of the important forts of the Maratha empire.<br> The name ‘Vishalgad’ means grand fort in Marathi, the name was given by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj after annexing it during 1660.<br> The structure covers an area of 1130 m and was built on a hilltop in the Sahyadri mountain ranges at a height of 3500 feet above sea level, and is about 76 km north – west of Kolhapur.
    <br>Vishalgad Fort was built in the year 1058 by a Shilahara ruler ‘Marsinh’ and was initially known as ‘Khilgil’ fort. But down the centuries it passed into the hands of many rulers who ruled around the Deccan region.
     </p>
    <p><b>
        Battle of Pawankhind:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
        Battle of Pävankhind was a rearguard last stand that took place on 13 July 1660 at a mountain pass in the vicinity of fort Vishalgad, near the city of Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India between the Maratha Sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Siddi Masud (later known as Siddi Jauhar ) of Bijapur Sultanate.<br><br>
        After Defeating Afjhalkhan, In the early 1660 the Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was trapped in the fort of Panhala, under siege and vastly outnumbered by an Adilshahi army led by an Abyssinian named Siddi Masud. Maharaj Planned to escape to the fort of Vishalgadh, which was administered by a Maratha chieftain named Range Narayan Orpe. Two Maratha sardars of the Adilshahi Commander Siddi Jouhar namely Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgadh simultaneously. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj waited for months, planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source. He waited until he reckoned that they needed to gather more food, and then started his plan.<br><br>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Veer Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, hardened mountaineers of the Maval region, would dash through the Adilshahi force at night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivaji Maharaj’s appearance, had volunteered to dress like the king and get captured. It was envisaged that this would buy some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi Masud realised the error and gave chase.
        On the Night of 13th July Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj made his escape, with his contingent of troops. Veer Baji Prabhu was second in command of this contingent. The Adilshahis gave hot and rapid pursuit, with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishagadh and the chasing Adilshahi army. The only option was to divide the forces where one of the section will stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination.<br><br>
        “लाख मेले तरी चालतील, पण लाखांचा पोशिंदा जगाला पाहिजे, राजे विशालगड गाठा, आणि पोहोचल्यास तोफांचे तीन वार द्या तोपर्यंत या गणीमास घोडखिंडीत अडकौन ठेवतो.”<br><br>
        After saying those final words to the king, Veer Bajiprabhu Deshpande occupied Ghod Khind,(a valley present in the Kolhapur region of Maharashtra ) blocking the path of the pursuers, and made a determined defence against them. His brother Fulaji Prabhu as well as sardars such as Shambusing Jadhav and 300 Maratha forces were present with him.<br><br>

    <p><b>Wearing Dandpatta in both the hands the fierce battle started, The Marathas genius in guerilla warfare took the advantages of the forest, valleys and were in the upper hand in the battle but few hours later  Fulaji Prabhu and Shambusing were killed after a gallant and fierce fights. Veer Baji Prabhu was severely wounded but carried on fighting at his station. The Adilshahi army repeatedly tried to break through the defenses of the pass, but were repeatedly repulsed. The unequal battle raged for hours, with the defenders maintaining their positions, but with rapidly depleting numbers. Only a handful of Marathas survived, and around a thousand soldiers of the Adilshahi army became casualties in attempting to take the pass.<br><br>
        On the other hand Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his 300 soldiers had to break through the encirclement of Suryarao and Jaswantrao at Vishalgadh. A fierce battle ensued in which Maharaj himself fought wearing Dandpatta in his both hands. Seeing this fight, the commander of Vishalgadh fort sent help to Maharaj enabling him and his troops to reach the fort safely. Five to Six hours after the battle, The cannon fire announcing Maharaj’s safe return to Vishalgadh was heard. Almost 300 Marathas had been killed, Legend has it that a gravely injured Veer Baji Prabhu continued engaging the enemy and held the pass, only laying down his life once he heard the sound of cannon fire. The handful surviving Marathas then retreated and disappeared in the forest as per the plan. Shivaji Mahraj’s plan was successful. Having made his way to Vishalgadh, Rango Narayan Orpe had fresh troops at his disposal. Veer Baji Prabhu had successfully fought the rear-guard action and slowed the Adilshahis forces before they arrived at the fort having carried on pursuing Shivaji Maharaj to Vishalgadh. The vengeful fresh Maratha troops carried out a blazing and bloody attack against Siddi Masood, Jasawantaro and Suryarao's forces inflicting heavy losses upon the latter when they arrived at the fort. The Adilshahi forces fled as a result of this attack.<br><br>
        One Maratha chronicler describes this fierce attack by mentioning that the 'green valleys of Vishalgadh were painted in red due to enemy's blood'. Shivaji Maharaj then safely crossed the western ghats and reached his capital Rajgad via Konkan region. Shivaji Maharaj later personally visited the house of the slain Baji Prabhu, which was in the village of Kasabe Sindh in the Raigad district and honoured his family, including giving his eldest son a position of leadership and honour in the forces.The defence of the pass of Ghod Khind by about 300 Marathas led by the Baji Prabhu Deshpande was renamed “The Battle of Pavan Khind” which in Marathi means “The Battle of the Sacred Pass”.<br><br>
        Another history is about in 1844 it was one of the forts of Kolhapur State that initiated a rebellion against a Brahmin regent called Daji Krishna Pandit who had been installed by the British to govern the state in 1843 at a time when the natural heir to the throne was underage. He took direction from a political agent of the East India Company and among their actions were reforms to the tax of land. These reforms caused much resentment and, despite Kolhapur having refrained from involvement in the previous Anglo-Maratha Wars, a revolt against the British began in 1844. The rebellion began with soldiers locking themselves into hill-forts such as those as Panhala and Vishalgad, and then spread to Kolhapur itself.
