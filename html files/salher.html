            Salher is the site of the highest fort in the Sahyadri mountains and the second highest peak at 1567 metres (5,141 ft) after Kalsubai in Maharashtra and also 32nd highest peak in Western Ghats. This fort is one of the celebrated forts of the Maratha empire.<br>   
    <br>According to a legend, Lord Parshuram did his Tapascharya at Salher Fort. After winning the earth and giving it as donation, he made land for himself to live in, by pushing the sea back with his arrows, right from this place.

        Battle of Salher:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
        The Treaty of Purandar (1665) required Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to cede 23 forts to the Mughals. Strategically important forts, which were fortified with garrisons, such as Sinhagad, Purandar, Lohagad, Karnala, and Mahuli were turned over to the Mughal empire. At the time of this treaty, the Nashik region, that contained the forts Salher and Mulher, was firmly in the Mughal Empire's hands since 1636. The signing of this treaty resulted in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s visit to Agra and after his famous escape from the same in September 1666, 2 years of ‘uneasy truce’ followed. However, the destruction of the temples of Viswanath and Benares along with Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s rejuvenated anti-hindu policies resulted in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj declaring war against the Mughals once again.<br><br>
        The period between 1670-1672 saw a dramatic rise in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s power and territory. Maharaja’s armies successfully conducted raids at Baglan, Khandesh, and Surat and retook more than a dozen forts.This culminated with a decisive victory against a Mughal army of more than 40,000 on an open field near Salher.<br><br>

    <p><b>Sardar Moropant Pingle and along with his army of 15,000 captured the Mughal forts Aundha, Patta, Trimbak and attacked Salher and Mulher in January 1671. This led Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to send two of his generals Ikhlas Khan and Bahlol Khan along with 12,000 horsemen to reclaim Salher. In October 1671, the Mughals laid siege on Salher. In return Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commanded his two commanders Sardar Moropant Pingle and Sardar Prataprao Gujar reclaim the fort. 50,000 Mughals had besieged the fort for more than 6 months. Maharaj knew the strategic importance of Salher as it was the main fort on important trade routes. Dilerkhan had also attacked Pune in the meanwhile and Maharaj could not save Pune because his main armies were away. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj devised a plan to divert Dilerkhan by forcing him reach Salher. He ordered Moropant who was in South Konkan and Prataprao who was raiding near Aurangabad to meet and attack Mughals at Salher to relieve the fort. <br><br>
        In his letter to his commanders Shivaji Maharaj had written 'Go to the north and attack Salher and defeat the enemy’ Both the Maratha forces met near the village of Vani, they bypassed the Mughal camp at Nashik and reached near Salher. The total Maratha strength was of 40,000(20,000 infantry + 20,000 cavalry). The terrain was not suitable for cavalry battle hence the Maratha commanders decided to lure, split and finish the Mughal forces at different places. As per the plan Prataprao Gujar stormed the Mughals with 5,000 cavalry and killed many unprepared soldiers. After half an hour the Mughals became fully ready and Prataprao started to flee with his army.<br><br>
        The entire Mughal cavalry of 25,000 started chasing the Marathas. Prataprao lured mughal cavalry in a pass 25 kms away from Salher where the 15,000 cavalries under Anand Rao Makaji was hiding. Prataprao turned his back in the pass and attacked the Mughals once again. The 15,000-fresh cavalry under Anand Rao blocked the other end of the pass and Mughals were surrounded from all sides. The fresh Maratha cavalry soundly defeated the tired Mughal cavalry in 2-3 hours. Thousands of Mughals fled the Battle.<br><br>
        Moropant later surrounded and attacked the 25,000 strong Mughal infantries at Salher with his 20,000 infantries. Prominent Maratha sardar and Maharaja's childhood friend Suryaji Kakde was killed by a Zamburak cannon in the battle.<br><br>
        The battle lasted for an entire day and it is estimated that around 10,000 men were killed on both the sides. The Mughal military machines (consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery) were outmatched by the light cavalry of the Marathas. The imperial Mughal armies were completely routed and the Marathas gave them a crushing defeat. 6,000 horses, an equal number of camels, 125 elephants, and an entire Mughal train were captured by the victorious Maratha Army. Other than this, a large amount of goods, treasures, gold, jewels, clothes, and carpets were seized by the Marathas. Also The money acquired after raiding Surat was brought to this fort first on its way to the Maratha capital forts.<br><br>
        The Sabhasad Bakhar describes the battle as follows "As the fighting began, such a (cloud of) dust arose that for a space of a three-kilometre square, friend and foe could not be distinguished. Elephants were killed. Ten thousand men on the two sides became corpses. The horses, camels, elephants (killed) were beyond counting. A flood of blood streamed (in the battlefield). The blood formed a muddy pool and in it (people) began to sink, so (deep) was the mud." <br><br>
        The battle resulted in a decisive Maratha victory which resulted in the liberation of Salher. Further, the nearby fort of Mulher was also taken from the Mughals as a consequence of this battle. 22 wazirs of note were taken as prisoners and Ikhlas Khan and Bahlol Khan were captured. Among the Mughal soldiers who were prisoners around one or two thousand escaped. The notable Panchazari Sardar of the Maratha army Suryajirao Kakade was killed in this battle and was revered for his ferocity during the battle. Approximately a dozen Maratha sardars were gifted for their remarkable achievements in the battle and the two officers (Sardar Moropant Pingle and Sardar Prataprao Gujar) were specially rewarded.<br><br>
        In the 18th century, the Peshwas occupied this fort and later by the British.

    The Rathore dynasty of Bagul ancestry reigned Baglan between 1310 and 1638. Mulher fort was their capital. The Mughals then gained control of Baglan. For the Surat ransack of January 1664 & October 1670, Shivaji Maharaj had followed the route passing through Baglan to reach Surat. On the first occasion, the entire region from Pune to Surat was under the command of the Mughals while on the second occasion, Baglan was mainly under their control. The Mughals chased Shivaji Raje on his return journey but they were defeated in the Kanchana Pass. Soon after this, Shivaji Maharaj began a campaign in this region. In January 1671 the first assault brought the Salher fort under the Maratha rule. They then attacked Mulher fort but the Mughal Killedar repulsed the attack. However, the Marathas captured the Chaulher fort. In October 1671, the Mughals laid siege to Salher fort. But Shivaji Maharaj despatched Moropant and Prataprao to break down the siege. They not only lifted the siege of Salher, but also attacked Mulher and captured it in February 1672. This feat resulted in the assimilation of the entire Baglan region into Swarajya.
