        History Of Korigad:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
        Not much information is known about Korigad. But Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj incorporated this fort in Swarajya along with Lohgad, Visapur, Tung and Tikona in 1657.
 On March 11, 1818, Col. Prother invaded this fort but could not succeed even after prolonged fighting. Finally, he succeeded on 14th March, by dropping a cannon ball where the ammunition was stored. Along with this fort the English also conquered Ghangad.

    <p><b>
       A temple to its patron goddess Koraidevi also exists along with several smaller temples to dedicated to Vishnu and Shiva. The former has been recently renovated and has a 3-foot-high Deepmala (tower of lamps). The interesting part of the fort is that its wall is completely intact and one can walk along its entire perimeter (about 2 km). Its massive gate is also intact. Several ruins of older structures within the fort still exist. It has six cannons - the largest of which called the Laxmi Toph is located near the Korai Devi temple.

Buses are available up to INS Shivaji and the remaining distance of about 1.6 km has to be covered on foot. Legend has it that while being chased by a tiger once, the Maratha Empire king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj jumped into a ditch on the hill and the tiger leaped off it into the valley giving it the name of tiger's leap.
        Just around tiger's leap, there is a small waterfall active only during the monsoon. It serves the purpose of relaxing in the water better than Bushi dam, as the force of the fall is higher. Also, after the brief steep descent, the fall becomes a stream with a fair amount of force to go all the way down to the base of the Tiger's Leap. Adventurers can trek down the stream whilst intermittently stepping back on land where the water current is too strong and the fall is steep.

    <p><b>
     1) Hotel Rama Krishna:- <br>If there ever was a better, breaking fast and meeting point than this landmark 26-year-old, highway-touch Udipi eatery, we can’t say. But as of 2016, just about anyone visiting Lonavala or driving through on the old Mumbai-Pune highway, ends up stretching and eating at least one piping hot portion of RK’s idli sambar. On weekends, come rain or shine, the Shetty-run establishment plates up a staggering 500 steaming rice roundels drowned in spicy-hot sambar served with freshly grated, green coconut chutney (Rs 55), says manager Somnath Shetty. Finally, contrary to popular belief, RK serves meat and in fact, makes a mean butter chicken besides for housing a well-stocked domestic bar.<br><br>
     2) Hotel Rudra:-<br> If you’re having difficulty getting your friends and family out of the house, we suggest you lean over and whisper: Kailash Parbat and chole bhature, in no particular order. Thirty minutes later, you may find yourself seated in front of two greasy, globe-size bhaturas accompanied by a big bowl of spicy curried chickpeas. This somewhat unofficial dish of New Delhi finds countless takers in plateau country simply because KP ensures that their bread is delicious on its own: crisp yet soft. So… make no ceremony, rip off a piece and scoop up the well-spiced chole to eat well.<br><br>
     3) Hotel Sainath:-<br> There’s a three-decade-old adage that’s been doing the rounds of the valleys between Lonavala and Khandala. It goes something like this: “They checked into Fariyas but they breakfasted at Buwa’s.” Buwa, being the proprietor of Buwachi missal. No one calls it Hotel Sainath’s misal. Historically speaking, authentic Maharashtrian misal is made of usal (a curried sprouted lentil and bean jus), poha, chivda, farsan, onions and tomato. And that’s exactly what you get here for R50, with two pavs. Those who can’t handle spice, ask owner Ashok Gaikwad to hold the usal and add extra farsan. Be warned, the weekend wait can be long and painful.<br><br>
     4) Maganlal Chikki (Since 1880):-<br> An ultimate after-meal companion for western India, Chikki products are tempting and mouth-watering compelling one to gulp again and again. Maganlal Chikkis is one such brand famous for manufacturing amazing quality of Chikkis with unique varieties to eat. Starting from groundnut chikkis to healthy dry fruit chikkis, Magalal chikkis serves the best of its products to its customers. Maganlal Chikki, which has dozens of outlets there, is among the biggest manufacturers of the sweet.         
     The pioneers of Chikki, Maganlal Chikki started manufacturing crispy and unputdownable Chikkis way before independence and the rest is history. Their offerings have evolved over time and now serve the world. However, what sets them apart is their high-quality and the ability to curate unique flavors of Chikki to eat.
     <br><br>
     5) Fudge Factory:-<br> Lonavala is famous for many things, hills, waterfalls, treks, chikki and of course fudge! There are few very famous chikki and fudge manufacturing stores like Cooper’s fudge, Maganlal’ Fudge, etc.<br>
     Beyond this, the first time in Lonavala, a live fudge factory is one of the main attractions for peoples from Lonavala and all other travelers. Live manufacturing, live packaging and free sampling available to eat. Everything in front of you. As we know Lonavala is a very crowded place but nothing to worry about because this fudge factory provides you free parking. They also provide home delivery.<br>
       Here you can eat six different varieties of fudges namely chocolate walnut, chocolate almond, plain chocolate, custard apple, strawberry, and mango, and all varieties cost Rs 300 for 250 gm.  Nevertheless, their upcoming varieties are rose, vanilla, butterscotch and all are sugar-free fudges.
<br><br>
     6) Golden Vadapav:-<br> Golden Vada Pav on Old Mumbai-Pune highway is perhaps the most sought after street-food joint in Lonavala. There is no doubt about its popularity. At any given time, the place is crowded with patrons while the staff fries fresh vadas in front of them.          
     Vadapav with incredible Chutney is the star of the dish! The Thecha is flavorsome and further enhances the taste of the hot, crispy Vada Pavs, made right in front of you in a large batch. Golden Vada Pav serves the tastiest Vada Pav that you crave to have again and again.
