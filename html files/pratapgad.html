                  Pratapgad (Marathi: प्रतापगड) literally 'Valour Fort' is a large fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. Significant as the site of the Battle of Pratapgad, the fort is now a popular tourist destination. Pratapgad fort is located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Poladpur and 23 kilometres (14 mi) west of Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in the area. The fort stands 1,080 metres (3,540 ft) above sea level[3] and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.

      <center><h4>Assasination of Afzalkhan</h4></center>
      </div>
  </div>
    <p><b>
      The Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass.It was completed in 1656.<br><br>
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj sent an emissary to Afzal Khan, stating that he did not want to fight and was ready for peace. A meeting was arranged between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan at a shamiyana (highly decorated tent) at the foothills of Pratapgad. It was agreed that they would bring only ten personal bodyguards each with them. All the ten bodyguards would remain 'one arrow-shot' away from the pair. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj chose Sambhaji Kondhalkar, Jiva Mahala, Siddi Ibrahim, Kataji Ingle, Kondaji Kank, Yesaji Kank, Krishnaji Gayakwad, Surji Katake, Visaji Murambak & Sambhaji Karvar for the meet. Afzal Khan hid a katyar (a small dagger) in his coat, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj wore armour underneath his clothes and carried a concealed wagh nakha in one hand.<br><br>
      As the two men entered the tent, the 6'7" tall Khan embraced Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He then tried to strangle Maharaj in his vice-like grip and pierced his dagger in Shivaji. But the armour under Maharaj's clothes saved him. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj retaliated by using his "wagh nakh" (tiger claws) to slash Khan's stomach and disemboweled Khan. <br><br>
      Thereupon Afzal Khan's bodyguard Bada Sayyed attacked Maharaj with swords but Jiva Mahala, Maharaj's personal bodyguard fatally struck him down. Also a lawyer of afzal khan krushna bhaskar kulkarni attacked on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj being aware he killed krushna kulkarni by sword. Afzal Khan managed to hold his gushing entrails and hurtled, faint and bleeding, outside the tent and threw himself into his palanquin. The bearers hastily lifted their charge and began moving rapidly away down the slope. Sambhaji Kavji Kondhalkar, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 's lieutenant and one of the accompanying guards, gave chase and beheaded Afzal Khan. The severed head was later sent to Rajgad to be shown to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 's mother, Rajmata Jijabai. She had long wanted vengeance for the deliberate maltreatment of Shahaji Maharaj(Shivaji Maharaj father) while a captive of Afzal Khan, and for his role in the death of her elder brother, Sambhaji Shahaji raje Bhosle. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj speed up the slope towards the fortress and his lieutenants ordered cannons to be fired. It was a signal to his infantry, hidden in the densely forested valley, to raid the Adilshahi forces.<br><br>
      Maratha troops commanded by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 's captain Kanhoji Jedhe, swept down on Afzal Khan's 1,500 musketeers; resulting in a complete rout of the musketeers at the foothills of the fort. Then in a rapid march, a section of Adilshahi forces commanded by Musekhan was attacked. Musekhan, Afzal Khan's lieutenant, was wounded and subsequently fled the field.<br><br>
      Meanwhile, Moropant led the Maratha infantry toward the left flank of Adilshahi troops. The suddenness of this attack on Afzal Khan's artillery at close quarters made them ineffective in providing artillery cover for the main portion of their troops. And as a result of this the rest of their troops rapidly succumbed to an all out Maratha attack. Simultaneously Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 's Sardar (captain), Ragho Atre's cavalry units swooped down and attacked the large but unprepared Adilshahi cavalry before they were able to be fully geared up for battle and succeeded in completely routing them in short order.<br><br>
      The Maratha cavalry under Netaji Palkar pursued the retreating Adilshahi forces, who were attempting to join up with the part of their reserve forces stationed in the nearby village of Wai. They were engaged in battle before they could regroup and were defeated prior to reaching Wai. The Adilshahi forces not withstanding the onslaught of the Marathas started retreating towards Bijapur. The Maratha army chased the retreating army and on their way captured 23 Adilshahi forts. In fact, the Adilshahi Killedar of the Kolhapur fort (Panhalgad ) himself handed over the keys to the Marathas.<br><br>

      Aftermath:
    </b></p>
    <p><b>Adilshahi forces lost their artillery, 65 elephants, 4000 horses, 1200 camels, jewels worth 300,000 Rupees, 1,000,000 Rupees, heaps of precious clothes, tents to the Marathas. They also lost their money and grain stored at Wai. 5,000 Adilshahi soldiers were killed and almost as many were wounded. 3,000 soldiers were imprisoned, and the remainder were allowed to go home in defeat. The Marathas lost 1,734 soldiers, while 420 soldiers were wounded.<br><br>
      As it was the policy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to humanely treat the defeated army, neither the men nor women were sold as slaves or molested. Wounded commanders were offered treatment deserving of their rank and either imprisoned or sent back to Bijapur. Some of the defeated Adilshahi generals like Siddi Hilal changed their loyalties and joined the Marathas to serve under Maharaj. Two of Afzal Khan’s sons were captured by the Marathas but were let off by the Maharaj. Fazal khan (son of Afzal Khan) and the Adilshahi soldiers with him who were badly injured were shown a safe passage out of the forest of Jawli by Prataprao More. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also buried Afzal Khan as per Islamic customs and built his tomb near Pratapgarh, as per his philosophy of ‘once the enemy is dead, the enmity is dead too’.<br><br>
      The sword of honour was presented to Kanhoji Jedhe for his invaluable and outstanding performance of service to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The relatives of the killed soldiers were offered service in the Maratha army. Families without any male left alive to support, the family were awarded pensions. Heroes of the war were rewarded with medals, kada (bracelets) and horses.<br><br>
      Khan's death dealt the Adilshah's rule a severe blow. A quarter of his territory, forts and a fifth of his army were captured or destroyed, while King Shivaji doubled his territory, losing a tenth of his army, within fifteen days of the Battle of Pratapgadh. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj maintained his momentum, sending cavalry towards Kolhapur, which succeeded in capturing seventeen forts, including the prestigious fort of Panhala. Cavalry was also sent towards Dabhol and Rajapur under the command of Doroji Patil, which was successful in capturing forts in the southern Konkan<br><br>
      This remarkable victory made Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj a hero of Maratha folklore and a legendary figure among his people. Having established military dominance and successfully beaten back a major attack by a powerful empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had founded the nucleus of what would become the Maratha Empire.<br><br>

     <p><b>What to see on fort ?</b></p>
    <p><b>
      The fort can be divided into the lower fort and upper fort.
      <br><br>
      The upper fort was built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180m long on each side. It has several permanent buildings, including a temple to the god Mahadev. It is located at the northwest of the fort, and is surrounded by sheer cliffs with drops of up to 250m.
      <br><br>
      The lower fort is around 320m long and 110m wide. It is located at the southeast of the fort, and is defended by towers and bastions ten to twelve metres high.
      <br><br>
      The Afzal tower extends out from the fort proper and defends the approach to the fort. It is said to have been constructed after the Battle of Pratapgad, and Afzal Khan's body is said to be buried under the tower.
      <br><br>
      In 1661, Shivaji Maharaj was unable to visit the temple of the goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur. He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50' long, 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but covered in lead covering put up by the Satara Raja Pratapsinha (1818–1839). A small spire or shikhar covers the shrine.The temple also has the sword of Maratha General Hambirao Mohite adorned with 6 diamond stones signifying that he had killed 600 soldiers in the battle. There is also a spatikha linga being worshipped inside the temple.The armors used in the battle during that period by the infantry soldiers are also on display just outside the temple, A dargah of Afzal Khan is located a short while away from the fort to the south-east.
